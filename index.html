    <p>Cats are especially expressive creatures, and they're constantly telling you exactly how they're feeling – all you have to do is learn to “speak cat”! ... Cats have scent glands around their mouth, chin, and cheeks that leave behind their unique scent when rubbed. This behavior is known as “bunting.”</p>
    <p>Cat communication, is the transfer of information by one or more cats that has an effect on the current or future behaviour of another animal, including humans. Cats use a range of communication modalities including vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory.</p>
